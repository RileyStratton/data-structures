# Tree

## Overview

Trees are the most different, and complicated, of the three data structures covered in this tutorial. They are most similar to a linked list. The easiest way to explain this is with an example.

Imagine you a looking at some sort of family tree. It starts with you, but as you go up, you are connected to both your mother and father. You are linked on the left to your father, and right to your mother. As you continue along the tree each person is linked to their two parents.

Now, if we flip that upside down it makes a tree data structure. The initial node is the root. It is connected to two children, the left and right value. If a node has children it is also a parent. Leaves are the nodes without any children. A classic tree can have an infinite number of children, but we are going to focus on binary trees.

Most commonly, trees are binary search trees, meaning that the value on the left is less than the parent, and value on the right is greater than the parent. This makes it possible to search the tree very quickly. For example, if you wanted to find 14, you would start with the root 15. Since it's less than 15 it looks to the left. It finds 10 there, and since 14 is greater than ten, you look to the right.
